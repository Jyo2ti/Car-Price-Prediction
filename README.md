# Car-Price-Prediction Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Type
**Major Project (Group Project – 4 Members)**

This project was completed collaboratively by a team of four members as part of our academic / internship-based learning program.

---

## 🚗 Project Overview
The objective of this project is to build a **Machine Learning model** that predicts the **selling price of used cars** based on various features such as car age, fuel type, transmission, and ownership history.

Accurate car price prediction helps both buyers and sellers make informed decisions in the automobile market.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Used car prices depend on multiple factors and are often difficult to estimate accurately.  
This project aims to analyze historical car data and apply **regression techniques** to predict car prices efficiently.

## 📂 Dataset Description
The dataset contains information about used cars with the following key features:

- Car_Name  
- Year  
- Selling_Price (Target Variable)  
- Present_Price  
- Kms_Driven  
- Fuel_Type  
- Seller_Type  
- Transmission  
- Owner
